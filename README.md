# Support-Youth-Build-Youth-Website
My first Website to Support Youth Build Youth is piloting a program to show how intergenerational cooperation can help turn the Africa youth population bulge curse into population dividends. <br>
	The program is based on the view that the population dynamics can be harnessed and nurtured through experiential leadership and engagements across ages to enhance skills and knowledge transfer, mentorship and talents development.
