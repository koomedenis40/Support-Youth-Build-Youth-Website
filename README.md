## Support Youth Build Youth Website <SYBYS />
My first website aimed to Support Youth Build Youth, a pilot program to show how intergenerational cooperation can help turn the African youth population bulge curse into population dividends. <br>
The program believes population dynamics can be harnessed and nurtured through experiential leadership and engagements across ages to enhance skills and knowledge transfer, mentorship, and talent development. <br>
